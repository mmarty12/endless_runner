### Description
This is the endless runner platformer game where player's aim is to run as far as possible, jumping over various traps, blocks, holes, and collecting coins to buy additional skin coloring for the character.

The short preview video with main functionality is down below:

On launching the game, you can adjust the level of music/sound effects to your preferences or mute the sound at all by clicking the following buttons. The info bar below shows your Best and Last scores, as well as the number of collected coins.

The game starts by taping on the screen. Your character can jump (by pressing "Space" or on the left half of the screen) and slide (by pressing "Arrow down" or on the right half of the screen). Such mechanics were made for adjusting the game for mobile users. The info bars show your collected coins, current run distance, and "extra life" (heart will turn red as you run faster). Mind that it is prohibited to slide or double jump all the time. See the icon up near the info bar that indicates the current ability to slide. The "extra life" will allow you to dodge one missed trap in the future. You can regain it back after 7s as you were hit. 

All in all, there are 11 different variants of levels that are generated in random order.

On dying you'll see a popping window with your achievements. You can also spend the coins in the shop in order to buy the skin for the next run.

The game was developed using Unity engine and C# scripts. You can test it yourself by following the [link](https://mmart004.itch.io/endless-runner) :)
